## 1. Introduction

a. Introduction:
Nowadays, everyone has their own cellphone that they can use to access whatever they like. Therefore, we have created an application named FoodZilla to help users connect with their favorite restaurants or discover new ones.

b. Problem Definition:
The system aims to address the following needs and problems:
- Users want a convenient way to order food from their favorite restaurants.
- Users want to explore new restaurants and their special recipes.
- Restaurant owners want a platform to showcase their menu and attract customers.

c. Scope of the System:
FoodZilla is a mobile application that allows customers to browse restaurants, view menus, search for specific meals or restaurants, add meals to their cart, and place orders. The system will also provide recommendations based on the user's previous orders.

d. Similar Systems:
FoodZilla competes with existing food delivery applications, such as Uber Eats and Zomato. However, it differentiates itself by offering unique features and a user-friendly interface.
